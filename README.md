# EMR-SYSTEM-FRESH
The goal of this EMR System is to integrate a User-Friendly interface/frontend that delivers a modern feel to the user and possesses an equally effective workflow, that helps providers and their staff deliver faster healthcare to thei patients without the pain points and frictions that come with many EMR systems. 
This started out as a focus to Urgent Care workflows as my experience with rather old emr systems brought me to wanting to create something that is just as affordable as other emr systems but bring an enterprise level feel to smaller/medium sized practices. 

Starting with Urgent Cares, this system will be adapted to work for all sized offices and different specialties ranging from urgent care --> dentistry --> psychology --> and more. 

The end goal will be to further enhance patient/practice data by tying up critical information to blockchain security such as Corda. 

Further goals ----> establish as we scale a "pre-authorization" insurance system with hopes to work with insurance companies and practices alike to relieve friction between clearing insruance dependent authorizations when ordered by physicians.
